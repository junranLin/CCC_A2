The data spans  2018/2019 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 SA4 boundaries.\n<br/><br/>\n\nJobs in Australia provide aggregate statistics and are sourced from the Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers.<br/><br/>\n\nThe job counts in this release differ from the filled job estimates from other sources such as the Australian Labour Account and the Labour Force Australia. The Jobs in Australia release provides insights into all jobs held throughout the year, while the Labour Account data provides the number of filled jobs at a point-in-time each quarter (and annually for the financial year reference period), and Labour Force Survey data measures the number of people employed each month. <br/><br/>\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/jobs-australia-methodology/2014-15-2018-19\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a><br/><br/>\n This release provides statistics on the number and nature of jobs, the people who hold them, and their employers. These statistics can be used to understand regional labour markets or to identify the impact of major changes in local communities. The release also provides new insights into the number of jobs people hold, the duration of jobs, and the industries and employment income of concurrent jobs.<br/><br/>\n\nThe scope of these data includes individuals who submitted an individual tax return to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), individuals who had a Pay As You Go (PAYG) payment summary issued by an employer and their employers.<br/><br/>\n SUDO has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/earnings-and-work-hours/jobs-australia/latest-release#data-download\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.
